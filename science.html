                        Until now, popular science has relegated the atom to a supporting role in defining the different chemical elements of the periodic table. 
                        In this book, Jack Challoner places the atom at center stage. The Atom investigates the quest to identify the smallest, 
                        most fundamental constituents of matter―and how that quest helps us to understand what everything is made of and how it all works. 
                        Challoner covers a wide range of topics―including the development of scientific thinking about atoms and the basic structure of atoms;
                        how atomic interactions account for the familiar properties of everyday materials; the power of the atomic nucleus; 
                        and what the mysterious quantum realm of subatomic particles can tell us about the very nature of reality.

                        Brian Greene, one of the world's leading string theorists, peels away layers of mystery to reveal a universe that consists of eleven dimensions, 
                        where the fabric of space tears and repairs itself, and all matter―from the smallest quarks to the most gargantuan supernovas―is generated by 
                        the vibrations of microscopically tiny loops of energy. The Elegant Universe makes some of the most sophisticated concepts ever contemplated accessible and
                        thoroughly entertaining, bringing us closer than ever to understanding how the universe works.

                        In his phenomenal bestseller A Brief History of Time, Stephen Hawking literally transformed the way we think about physics, 
                        the universe, reality itself. In these thirteen essays and one remarkable extended interview, the man widely regarded as 
                        the most brilliant theoretical physicist since Einstein returns to reveal an amazing array of possibilities for understanding our universe.

                        Building on his earlier work, Hawking discusses imaginary time, how black holes can give birth to baby universes, and scientists’ efforts to find 
                        a complete unified theory that would predict everything in the universe. With his characteristic mastery of language, his sense of humor and commitment 
                        to plain speaking, Stephen Hawking invites us to know him better—and to share his passion for the voyage of intellect and imagination that has opened 
                        new ways to understanding the very nature of the cosmos.

                        With The Elements, Gray gave us a never-before-seen, mesmerizing photographic view of the 118 elements in the periodic table. In Molecules, 
                        he showed us how the elements combine to form the content that makes up our universe. With Reactions Gray once again puts his one-of-a-kind photography 
                        and storytelling ability to work demonstrating how molecules interact in ways that are essential to our very existence. The book begins with 
                        a brief recap of elements and molecules and then goes on to explain important concepts the characterize a chemical reaction, including Energy, 
                        Entropy, and Time. It is then organized by type of reaction including chapters such as "Fantastic Reactions and Where to Find Them,
                        " "On the Origin of Light and Color," "The Boring Chapter," in which we learn about reactions such as paint drying, grass growing, and water boiling, 
                        and "The Need for Speed," including topics such as weather, ignition, and fire.

                            Spacetime and Geometry is an introductory textbook on general relativity, specifically aimed at students. 
                            Using a lucid style, Carroll first covers the foundations of the theory and mathematical formalism, providing an approachable

                            introduction to what can often be an intimidating subject. Three major applications of general relativity are then discussed: black holes,
                            perturbation theory and gravitational waves, and cosmology. Students will learn the origin of how spacetime curves (the Einstein equation) 
                            and how matter moves through it (the geodesic equation). They will learn what black holes really are, how gravitational waves are generated
                            and detected, and the modern view of the expansion of the universe. A brief introduction to quantum field theory in curved spacetime is also 
                            included. A student familiar with this book will be ready to tackle research-level problems in gravitational physics.
