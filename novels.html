                        <li>1.Pressured by her unscrupulous family to marry a wealthy man she detests,
                            the young Clarissa Harlowe is tricked into fleeing with the witty and debonair Robert Lovelace and places herself under his protection. 
                            Lovelace, however, proves himself to be an untrustworthy rake whose vague promises of marriage are 
                            accompanied by unwelcome and increasingly brutal sexual advances. And yet, Clarissa finds his charm alluring, 
                            her scrupulous sense of virtue tinged with unconfessed desire. Told through a complex series of interweaving letters, 
                            Clarissa is a richly ambiguous study of a fatally attracted couple and a work of astonishing power and immediacy. 
                            A huge success when it first appeared in 1747, and translated into French and German, it remains one of the greatest of all European novels.

                            Regarded as the preeminent prose satirist in the English language, Jonathan Swift (1667–1745) intended this masterpiece, 
                            as he once wrote Alexander Pope, to "vex the world rather than divert it.
                            " Savagely ironic, it portrays man as foolish at best, and at worst, not much more than an ape.
                            The direct and unadorned narrative describes four remarkable journies of ship's surgeon Lemuel Gulliver, among them, one to the land of Lilliput, 
                            where six-inch-high inhabitants bicker over trivialities; and another to Brobdingnag, a land where giants reduce man to insignificance.
                            Written with disarming simplicity and careful attention to detail, this classic is diverse in its appeal: for children, it remains an enchanting fantasy. 
                            For adults, it is a witty parody of political life in Swift's time and a scathing send-up of manners and morals in 18th-century England.

                            COMPLETE AND UNABRIDGED. With a new Introduction by Cedric Watts, Research Professor of English, University of Sussex. James Joyces astonishing masterpiece,
                            Ulysses, tells of the diverse events which befall Leopold Bloom and Stephen Dedalus in Dublin on 16 June 1904, during which Blooms voluptuous wife, 
                            Molly, commits adultery. Initially deemed obscene in England and the USA, this richly-allusive novel, revolutionary in its Modernistic experimentalism, 
                            was hailed as a work of genius by W. B. Yeats, T. S. Eliot and Ernest Hemingway. Scandalously frank, wittily erudite, mercurially eloquent, 
                            resourcefully comic and generously humane, Ulysses offers the reader a life-changing experience.

                            The Pilgrim's Progress from This World to That Which Is to Come; Delivered under the Similitude of a Dream is a Christian allegory written by 
                            John Bunyan (1628–1688) and published in February, 1678. It is regarded as one of the most significant works of religious English literature,
                            has been translated into more than 200 languages, and has never been out of print. 
                            Bunyan began his work while in the Bedfordshire county prison for violations of the Conventicle Act, which prohibited the holding of religious 
                            services outside the auspices of the established Church of England. Early Bunyan scholars like John Brown believed The Pilgrim's Progress was begun in 
                            Bunyan's second, shorter imprisonment for six months in 1675,but more recent scholars like Roger Sharrock believe that it was begun during Bunyan's initial,
                            more lengthy imprisonment from 1660–72 right after he had written his spiritual autobiography, Grace Abounding to the Chief of Sinners.

                            Frankenstein; or, The Modern Prometheus is the original 1818 'Uncensored' Edition of Frankenstein as first published anonymously in 1818. 
                            This original version is much more true to the spirit of the author's original intentions than the heavily revised 1831 edition, edited by Shelley, 
                            in part, because of pressure to make the story more conservative. Many scholars prefer the 1818 text to the more common 1831 edition. 
                            Frankenstein is a novel written by Mary Shelley about a creature produced by an unorthodox scientific experiment. Shelley started writing the story 
                            when she was nineteen, and the novel was published when she was twenty-one. Shelley had travelled in the region of Geneva, where much of the story 
                            takes place, and the topics of galvanism and other similar occult ideas were themes of conversation among her companions, particularly her future husband,
                            Percy Shelley. The storyline emerged from a dream. Mary, Percy, Lord Byron, and John Polidori decided to have a competition to see who could write 
                            the best horror story. After thinking for weeks about what her possible storyline could be, Shelley dreamt about a scientist who created life and was 
                            horrified by what he had made. She then wrote Frankenstein.

                                Set amidst the real world events which occurred following the Jacobite rising of 1745, Robert Louis Stevenson’s 1886 novel “Kidnapped” is 
                                the story of David Balfour, who travels to meet his uncle and collect his inheritance following the death of his father. Betrayed by his Uncle,
                                David finds himself kidnapped by Captain Hoseason of the brig “Covenant”, who plans to sell him into slavery in the Carolina Colonies of America. 
                                However the ship is blown of course and driven back towards Scotland where in the fog it strikes a small vessel and brings aboard the Scottish 
                                soldier and Jacobite Alan Breck Stewart. With the help of Alan, David is able to escape his captors and soon finds himself in the middle of the 
                                struggle between the Scottish Highlanders and soldiers of the English government. Stranded in the Scottish wilderness David must fight for his life 
                                and return home to collect his rightful inheritance. Through the characters of Alan and David the conflict over Scottish independence from English 
                                rule is adventurously depicted. This edition is printed on premium acid-free paper and includes illustrations by N. C. Wyeth.
