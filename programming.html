                            This book is not just about learning to program; although you will learn to code. If you want to program professionally,
                            it is not enough to learn to code; that is why, in addition to helping you learn to program, I also cover the rest of the things you need to
                            know to program professionally that classes and books don't teach you. "The Self-taught Programmer" is a roadmap, a guide to take you from
                            writing your first Python program, to passing your first technical interview. I divided the book into five sections:<br>
                            1. Learn to program in Python 3 and build your first program.<br>
                            2. Learn Object-oriented programming and create a powerful Python program to get you hooked.<br>
                                3. Learn to use tools like Git, Bash, and regular expressions. Then use your new coding skills to build a web scraper.<br>
                                4. Study Computer Science fundamentals like data structures and algorithms.

                            introduces students to the fundamental concepts of computer programming languages and provides them with the tools necessary to evaluate 
                            contemporary and future languages. An in-depth discussion of programming language structures, such as syntax and lexical and syntactic analysis, 
                            also prepares readers to study compiler design.The Eleventh Edition maintains an up-to-date discussion on the topic with the removal of outdated 
                            languages such as Ada and Fortran. The addition of relevant new topics and examples such as reflection and exception handling in Python and Ruby 
                            add to the currency of the text. Through a critical analysis of design issues of various program languages, Concepts of Computer Programming Languages
                            teaches programmers the essential differences between computing with specific languages.

                            When it comes to game programming, C++ is the name of the game. If you aspire to move from game player to game creator, 
                            it all starts with learning the fundamentals of C++ and game-programming basics. With BEGINNING C++ THROUGH GAME PROGRAMMING, FOURTH EDITION,
                            you will find an up-to-date and thorough introduction to everything you need to get started--with no previous programming experience required. 
                            In the new fourth edition of this popular guide to learning C++, you will work with a complete program while learning each new concept and a game 
                            program at the end of each chapter. A final game project at the end of the book draws together everything you've learned. Written with the beginning 
                            programmer in mind, BEGINNING C++ THROUGH GAME PROGRAMMING, FOURTH EDITION is a great way to get started in game programming.
